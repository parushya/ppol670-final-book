# Spatial Regression  
## A Practical Introduction  

## Quarto Book Githib Pages link: https://parushya.github.io/ppol670-final-book/  
## Authors: Benjamin Reese, Parushya, Sarah Hayes  

## Brief Description of the Book
In this Quarto Book, we provide an introductory overview of Spatial Regression. Starting with basics of geospatial data and basic visualization, we go into an in-depth discussion of Spatial Regression. We discuss the core concept of spatial autocorrelation, how it provides an opportunity to improve OLS results and discuss the theoretical underpinnings of various statistics used to measure autocorrelation. We then apply all these concepts in an example of US Census Data.  
The code for majority of new concepts' application in `R` is provided inline.  
References to the literature and tutorials which we referred to are provided in the end.
