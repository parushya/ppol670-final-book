# Basics of Geospatial Data {.unnumbered}

In this short introduction, we discuss prerequisites, offer some
motivations, and cover basic geospatial analysis in *R*. To showcase the
power of geospatial analysis for applied researchers, we rely on an
application of spatial analysis to explore poverty and education in New
York. By the end of this chapter, you should be comfortable finding,
cleaning, and visualizing the spatial data that you are interested in.
Only when you have mastered these concepts, can you confidently begin to
model spatial relationships.

## Motivation  
Geospatial data is ubiquitous in the social sciences and tools to
systematically analyze spatial variables and spatial relationships
should be a part of every data scientist and social scientist's toolkit.
From visualizing election returns in American politics to depicting
different countries' gross domestic products (GDP), the ability to make
a map is immensely useful. Every article concerning state and local
politics in political science will usually showcase a map of states or
counties at some point in order to effectively illustrate the variables
important to the analysis. Macroeconomists and comparative political
scientists conducting cross-national studies similarly use maps to
illustrate the spatial distribution of their key variables. Even when
researchers are modeling relationships that are not inherently spatial,
including a map is a powerful visualization technique.

If the unit of analysis is a spatial unit - such as country-level,
state-level, county-level or topographical, maps are perhaps the best
way to visualize the distribution of your variables of interest across
space. Further, sociologists, economists, and epidemiologists who are
interested in examining crime and health data will find particular
advantages in being able to map crime rates, the prevalence of a
disease, or the health outcomes in different areas of a town or city.
Public administration and policy researchers who want to make
recommendations to decision-makers about where to build police stations,
hospitals, fire departments, parks, or concentrate COVID vaccination and
testing supplies, public assistance benefits, and relief efforts from
inclement weather can utilize a well-made map and spatial regression
techniques to draw conclusions from.

Perhaps most importantly, researchers who want their work to be
public-facing and read by people without technical expertise could find
more success by displaying their results and analysis through maps than
through tables or even other, non-map, data visualizations.

Geospatial data is also extremely common and readily available, with
easy access to US Census data through `library(tidycensus)` and
shapefiles and spatial data available through many cities, states, and
government agencies' data repositories. The use of application
programming interfaces (APIs) has made accessing the wealth of spatial
data collected by the world's governments and businesses extremely easy.
`library(sf)` also works well with `library(dplyr)` and
`library(ggplot2)` to make creating attractive maps just as easy as
accessing spatial data, overcoming the inherent challenges with spatial
data being multidimensional.

As a data scientist or social scientist thinking through their research
design and deliberating on the nature of the relationship they want to
model, if the variables or relationship that is decided on is spatial,
then making a basic map and thinking through the spatial distribution of
important variables, should be the researchers first step. Where do
researchers go after the creation of their map, though? The goal of this
treatment on spatial regression is to equip applied researchers with the
tools and theoretical background needed to go a step beyond mere
visualization and discussion of geospatial data to estimating geospatial
regression models. Further, readers will learn when spatial
autocorrelation could render standard errors from OLS models incorrect
and how to detect spatial autocorrelation in spatial data. Essentially,
whenever a researcher is modeling a relationship that has spatial
autocorrelation, they should use one of the techniques described in this
work to purge autocorrelation from the error term of their models. After
reading this, researchers will know when to use spatial regression
methods and how to visualize the results of spatial regression models.

## Two Types of Spatial Data

Spatial Data provides information on 'something' with respect to its location. This information is called _attribute_. In itself, attribute is not spatial data. In combination with information about it's position it becomes spatial data.  
_Temperature_ at a point when combined with latitutde or longitude, _height of a person_ in a room with respect to distance from two walls, etc., are all examples of attributes with information of location becoming spatial data.  
Purely spatial information of entities are represented by data models. Basic types of data models that we come across in geospatial analysis are the following:  
1.    Point - A single point.  
2.    Line - A stream of ordered points connected by straignt line segments.  
3.    Polygon - A set of lines forming a closed loop enclosing an area.  
4.    Grid - A collection of points or rectangular cells, orgnaised in regular lattice.  

The first three are known as __Vector Data__, and represent entities as exactly as possible while the the last one composes of __Raster Data__. Raster data is used to represent continuous values by breaking them into finer tesselations (Bivand et al, 2008).     
Same data can be expressed as both raster and vector data types. Just that in raster form, they are stored as values of pixels in amatrix of cells, in vector they are stored as values attrbutes in association with a set of coordinates.  
Shapefiles that we have been using are an example of vector data and and satellite images are examples of raster data.
